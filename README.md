# Tutor the AI

## Humans tutoring OpenAI on science concepts

---

_"If you want to master something, teach it."_

But who then is to be the learner? That's where the AI comes in.

**Tutor the AI** provides you with the opportunity to practice the [Feynman Learning Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) through tutoring an AI.

1. Choose something to learn
2. Try teaching it to a 6th grader (aka the AI)
3. Identify your gaps in understanding
4. Fill in those gaps

While I took down the hosted website, you're welcome to play around with it yourself if you have an OpenAI API key.
